Don't be fooled by the declarative syntax,
CSS is a powerful language for
building dynamic design systems.

<!-- more -->

CSS has come a long way
since the browser wars of the late 90s.
What used to be a struggle,
is now often a breeze
(see `box-shadow` or `border-radius`).
But the last 2 years have pushed CSS into entirely new territory:
with DOM-aware variables and calculations
that can drive your design,
without all the invasive Javascript.

- Basics for understanding Custom Properties & Calc().
- Practical examples and use-cases for data-infused design.
- Integrating with CSS Grids to build layouts on-the-fly.
